# knockoffspy

An interface to [Knockoffs.jl](https://github.com/biona001/Knockoffs.jl) from the Python programming language. `knockoffspy` provides unique high performance methods for sampling various model-X knockoffs and ships with built-in routines for variable selection. Much of the functionality are unique and allow for orders of magnitude speedup over conventional methods. 'knockoffspy' attaches a Python interface onto the package, allowing seamless use of this tooling by Python users. 

## Installation

To install `knockoffspy`, use pip
```
pip install knockoffspy
```
Then in the python interpreter,
```python
>>> import knockoffspy
>>> knockoffspy.install()
```
This will install the `Knockoffs.jl` package and all the Julia dependencies that it needs. 

## Usage

Import the package as
```python
from knockoffspy import ko
```
The general flow for using the package is to follow exactly as would be done in Julia, except add `ko.` in front of function calls. Most of the commands will work without any modification. Thus the [Knockoffs.jl documentation](https://biona001.github.io/Knockoffs.jl/dev/) is the main in-depth documentation for this package. Below we will show how to translate these docs to Python code.

## Documentation

Most of the commands of `Knockoffs.jl` will work in python without any modification, just add `ko.` in front of function calls. Thus the [Knockoffs.jl documentation](https://biona001.github.io/Knockoffs.jl/dev/) is the main in-depth documentation for this package. Below we will show how to translate these docs to Python code.

## Example: Exact model-X group knockoffs

Lets simulate `X ~ N(0, Sigma)` where `Sigma` is a symmetric Toesplitz matrix. Here we assume every 5 variables form a group

```python
from knockoffspy import ko
from scipy import linalg
import numpy as np

# generate data
n = 1000          # number of samples
p = 1000          # number of covariates
m = 1             # number of knockoffs to generate per feature
groups = np.repeat(np.arange(0,200,1), 5)
Sigma = linalg.toeplitz([0.7**i for i in range(1, p+1)])
mu = np.zeros(p)
X = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean=mu, cov=Sigma, size=(n,))
```
We generate model-X group knockoffs as follows
```python
solver = "maxent" # Maximum entropy solver, other choices include "mvr", "sdp", "equi"
result = ko.modelX_gaussian_group_knockoffs(X, solver, groups, mu, Sigma, verbose=True)

```python
Xko = result.Xko
S = result.S
obj = result.obj
